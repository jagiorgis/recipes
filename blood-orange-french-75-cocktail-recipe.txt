To make a twist of zest, use a vegetable peeler to peel a long strip of zest from the blood orange. Cut it into thin strips with a sharp knife. Twist it into a curly shape and hold it that way for a few seconds.

Ingredients
1 1/2 Tbsp (3/4 oz) freshly juiced blood orange juice, strained
1/2 Tbsp (1/4 oz) lime juice
1 1/2 Tbsp (3/4 oz) simple syrup*
1 1/2 oz (3 Tbsp) gin
1/4 cup (2 oz) champagne, prosecco, or other sparkling white wine
A twist of blood orange zest

*To make simple syrup, put equal parts of sugar and water into a small saucepan. (I usually make syrup with 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water, and store the excess for other uses.) Bring to a rolling boil. If you have a few strips of blood orange zest, add them to the water for extra flavor. When the sugar has all dissolved in the water, remove from heat and let cool. Remove the zest. Pour into a mason jar and store in the fridge.

Method
1 Place the blood orange juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and gin into a cocktail shaker (or something that can be used as a cocktail shaker) with a few ice cubes.
2 Shake to mix well and strain, pouring into a champagne flute.
3 Top with champagne, Prosecco, or sparkling white wine.
4 Add a twist of blood orange zest to the glass.
